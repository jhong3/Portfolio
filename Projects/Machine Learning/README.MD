#This folder contains an introductory program to Machine Learning written in Python 3 in Visual Studio 2019. It is currently a work-in-progress as the comments detailing and explaining the functionalities are incomplete - however, the program itself is fully functional.

Machine Learning is a set of algorithms that analyze a set of data and learn from that data to make informed decisions.
These algorithms are modeled after the human brain, i.e. have an artificial neural network with algorithms designed
to recognize patterns and output predictions. ML is divided into 3 categories: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
