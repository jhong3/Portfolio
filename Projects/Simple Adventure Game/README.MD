This folder contains a simple RPG game written in C# following the guide created by Scott Lilly. This project was created as I was learning C# in preparation for the MTA 98-361 exam. Because of its simple nature, it leaves a lot to be desired for the player expecting a complex game - however, it's a great program for C# beginners to read and learn.
